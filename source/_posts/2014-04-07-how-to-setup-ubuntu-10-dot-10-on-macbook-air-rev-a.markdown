My Macbook Air is the first edition - 1.6 GHz, 80GB HD (not SSD)

Insert the Ubuntu CD (I have the Superdrive), reboot, hold C to boot from CD and when Ubuntu live comes double click the Install icon.

Follow the on screen instructions.

For simplicity I decided to nuke OS X and let Ubuntu have the entire HD.

After the installation restart and everything works out of the box.

I even installed Skype and the iSight camera works great.

What an awesome job the grub guys have done supporting EFI too!

****UPDATE**** Microphone is not working and apparently has never worked - [ https://bugs.launchpad.net/mactel-support/+bug/268301](https://bugs.launchpad.net/mactel-support/+bug/268301)
